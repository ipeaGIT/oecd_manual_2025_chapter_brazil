    "text": "Preface\nAccessibility is the ease with which people can reach places and opportunities such as jobs, health and education services, cultural activities, green areas, etc. The accessibility conditions of a city or neighborhood depend on the efficiency and connectivity of the transport network and on the proximity between people and activities. The topic of accessibility has been receiving increased attention from transportation agencies, funding institutions, decision makers and researchers in the fields of urban and transport planning (Papa et al. 2015; Boisjoly and El-Geneidy 2017). In the last few years, we have seen a growing number of scientific papers (Miller 2018; van Wee 2021) and books (Levine, Grengs, and Merlin 2019; Levinson and King 2020) that deepen our understanding of urban accessibility issues. However, there are currently no books or articles that serve simultaneously as introductory material to the subject and as a practical manual to teach computational methods to calculate and analyze accessibility data. The lack of this type of material helps to explain, at least in part, why several transportation agencies and analysts still face challenges to incorporate accessibility issues and indicators into the day-to-day planning and research practice (Silva et al. 2017; Büttner 2021).\nThe aim of this book is to equip its readers with the fundamental concepts, the data analysis skills and the processing tools needed to perform urban accessibility analyses and transportation projects impact assessments. The book was written with the problems faced by public managers, policy makers, students and researchers working on urban and transportation planning in mind. Hence, the book is essentially practical. All the material in the book is presented with reproducible examples using open datasets and the R programming language.",

    "text": "1.1 Overview of the data\nThe AOP-Lab generates high spatial resolution estimates of access to employment, public health, education, and social welfare services by transportation mode for Brazil’s largest cities. All data produced by the lab is made publicly available, including not only accessibility estimates, but also information on the spatial distribution of population, economic activities and public services1. The data is spatially aggregated into a hexagonal grid indexed by the H3 geospatial indexing system, originally developed by Uber (Brodsky 2018). Each hexagonal cell covers around 0.11 km², an area similar to that covered by a city block, allowing for high spatial resolution analyses and outputs.\nAll accessibility estimates are generated by different transport modes (walking, cycling, public transport and automobile), times of day (peak and off-peak), population groups (aggregated by income, race, sex and age) and types of activity (jobs, schools, health services and social assistance centers). These accessibility estimates have been produced for various years 2017, 2018 and 2019 and for the 20 largest Brazilian cities, and the data is being expanded to cover more cities in from 2022 onwards.\nThe following tables summarize the data currently available.

    "text": "1.2 Downloading urban accessibility data for Brazil\nThe easiest way to get urban accessibility data for Brazilian cities is using the {aopdata} package (Pereira, Herszenhut, Braga, Tomasiello, et al. 2022). The also allows one to download estimates of accessibility to jobs, public health facilities, public schools and social assistance services for various years and multiple cities.\nThis data can be downloaded with the read_access() function, which works similarly to read_population() and read_landuse(). Besides indicating the city (city parameter) and the reference year (year), though, it is also necessary to inform the transport mode (mode) and the period of the day (peak parameter) to select the accessibility data that should be downloaded. The peak period is between 6 am and 8 am, while off-peak is between 2 pm and 4 pm.\nWith the code below, we show how to download accessibility estimates that refer to the peak period in São Paulo in 2019. In this example, we download accessibility estimates both by car and by public transport and merged them into a single data.frame. Please note that this function results in a table that also includes sociodemographic and land use data.\n\naccess_pt &lt;- aopdata::read_access(\n  city = \"São Paulo\",\n  mode = \"public_transport\",\n  year = 2019,\n  peak = TRUE,\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  showProgress = FALSE\n)\n\naccess_car &lt;- aopdata::read_access(\n  city = \"São Paulo\",\n  mode = \"car\",\n  year = 2019,\n  peak = TRUE,\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  showProgress = FALSE\n)\n\ndata_sp &lt;- rbind(access_pt, access_car)\n\nnames(data_sp)\n\n  [1] \"id_hex\"       \"abbrev_muni\"  \"name_muni\"    \"code_muni\"    \"year\"        \n  [6] \"P001\"         \"P002\"         \"P003\"         \"P004\"         \"P005\"        \n [11] \"P006\"         \"P007\"         \"P010\"         \"P011\"         \"P012\"        \n [16] \"P013\"         \"P014\"         \"P015\"         \"P016\"         \"R001\"        \n [21] \"R002\"         \"R003\"         \"T001\"         \"T002\"         \"T003\"        \n [26] \"T004\"         \"E001\"         \"E002\"         \"E003\"         \"E004\"        \n [31] \"M001\"         \"M002\"         \"M003\"         \"M004\"         \"S001\"        \n [36] \"S002\"         \"S003\"         \"S004\"         \"C001\"         \"mode\"        \n [41] \"peak\"         \"CMATT15\"      \"CMATB15\"      \"CMATM15\"      \"CMATA15\"     \n [46] \"CMAST15\"      \"CMASB15\"      \"CMASM15\"      \"CMASA15\"      \"CMAET15\"     \n [51] \"CMAEI15\"      \"CMAEF15\"      \"CMAEM15\"      \"CMAMT15\"      \"CMAMI15\"     \n [56] \"CMAMF15\"      \"CMAMM15\"      \"CMACT15\"      \"CMPPT15\"      \"CMPPH15\"     \n [61] \"CMPPM15\"      \"CMPPB15\"      \"CMPPA15\"      \"CMPPI15\"      \"CMPPN15\"     \n [66] \"CMPP0005I15\"  \"CMPP0614I15\"  \"CMPP1518I15\"  \"CMPP1924I15\"  \"CMPP2539I15\" \n [71] \"CMPP4069I15\"  \"CMPP70I15\"    \"CMATT30\"      \"CMATB30\"      \"CMATM30\"     \n [76] \"CMATA30\"      \"CMAST30\"      \"CMASB30\"      \"CMASM30\"      \"CMASA30\"     \n [81] \"CMAET30\"      \"CMAEI30\"      \"CMAEF30\"      \"CMAEM30\"      \"CMAMT30\"     \n [86] \"CMAMI30\"      \"CMAMF30\"      \"CMAMM30\"      \"CMACT30\"      \"CMPPT30\"     \n [91] \"CMPPH30\"      \"CMPPM30\"      \"CMPPB30\"      \"CMPPA30\"      \"CMPPI30\"     \n [96] \"CMPPN30\"      \"CMPP0005I30\"  \"CMPP0614I30\"  \"CMPP1518I30\"  \"CMPP1924I30\" \n[101] \"CMPP2539I30\"  \"CMPP4069I30\"  \"CMPP70I30\"    \"CMATT60\"      \"CMATB60\"     \n[106] \"CMATM60\"      \"CMATA60\"      \"CMAST60\"      \"CMASB60\"      \"CMASM60\"     \n[111] \"CMASA60\"      \"CMAET60\"      \"CMAEI60\"      \"CMAEF60\"      \"CMAEM60\"     \n[116] \"CMAMT60\"      \"CMAMI60\"      \"CMAMF60\"      \"CMAMM60\"      \"CMACT60\"     \n[121] \"CMPPT60\"      \"CMPPH60\"      \"CMPPM60\"      \"CMPPB60\"      \"CMPPA60\"     \n[126] \"CMPPI60\"      \"CMPPN60\"      \"CMPP0005I60\"  \"CMPP0614I60\"  \"CMPP1518I60\" \n[131] \"CMPP1924I60\"  \"CMPP2539I60\"  \"CMPP4069I60\"  \"CMPP70I60\"    \"CMATT90\"     \n[136] \"CMATB90\"      \"CMATM90\"      \"CMATA90\"      \"CMAST90\"      \"CMASB90\"     \n[141] \"CMASM90\"      \"CMASA90\"      \"CMAET90\"      \"CMAEI90\"      \"CMAEF90\"     \n[146] \"CMAEM90\"      \"CMAMT90\"      \"CMAMI90\"      \"CMAMF90\"      \"CMAMM90\"     \n[151] \"CMACT90\"      \"CMPPT90\"      \"CMPPH90\"      \"CMPPM90\"      \"CMPPB90\"     \n[156] \"CMPPA90\"      \"CMPPI90\"      \"CMPPN90\"      \"CMPP0005I90\"  \"CMPP0614I90\" \n[161] \"CMPP1518I90\"  \"CMPP1924I90\"  \"CMPP2539I90\"  \"CMPP4069I90\"  \"CMPP70I90\"   \n[166] \"CMATT120\"     \"CMATB120\"     \"CMATM120\"     \"CMATA120\"     \"CMAST120\"    \n[171] \"CMASB120\"     \"CMASM120\"     \"CMASA120\"     \"CMAET120\"     \"CMAEI120\"    \n[176] \"CMAEF120\"     \"CMAEM120\"     \"CMAMT120\"     \"CMAMI120\"     \"CMAMF120\"    \n[181] \"CMAMM120\"     \"CMACT120\"     \"CMPPT120\"     \"CMPPH120\"     \"CMPPM120\"    \n[186] \"CMPPB120\"     \"CMPPA120\"     \"CMPPI120\"     \"CMPPN120\"     \"CMPP0005I120\"\n[191] \"CMPP0614I120\" \"CMPP1518I120\" \"CMPP1924I120\" \"CMPP2539I120\" \"CMPP4069I120\"\n[196] \"CMPP70I120\"   \"TMIST\"        \"TMISB\"        \"TMISM\"        \"TMISA\"       \n[201] \"TMIET\"        \"TMIEI\"        \"TMIEF\"        \"TMIEM\"        \"TMICT\"       \n[206] \"geometry\"    \n\n\nThe data dictionary (code book) can be accessed online2 or with the command aopdata::aopdata_dictionary(lang = \"en\") in an R session.

The data includes three types of measures:\n\nCMA - active cumulative accessibility;\nCMP - passive cumulative accessibility; and\nTMI - minimum travel time to the nearest opportunity.\n\nThe type of activity to which the accessibility levels were calculated, indicated by the following two letters, in the middle of the column name. The data includes accessibility estimates to various types of activities:\n\nTT - all jobs;\nTB - low education jobs;\nTM - middle education jobs;\nTA - high education jobs;\nST - all public health facilities;\nSB - low complexity public health facilities;\nSM - medium complexity public health facilities;\nSA - high complexity public health facilities;\nET - all public schools;\nEI - early childhood public schools;\nEF - primary public schools;\nMS - secondary public schools;\nMT - total number of enrollments in public schools;\nMI - number of enrollments in early childhood public schools;\nMF - number of enrollments in primary public schools;\nMM - number of enrollments in secondary public schools; and\nCT - all CRAS.\n\n\nIn the case of the passive cumulative measure, the letters in the middle of the column name indicate the population group which the accessibility estimates refer to:\n\nPT - the entire population;\nPH - male population;\nPM - female population;\nPB - white population;\nPN - black population;\nPA - yellow population;\nPI - indigenous population;\nP0005I - population from 0 to 5 years old;\nP0614I - population from 6 to 14 years old;\nP1518I - population from 15 to 18 years old;\nP1924I - population from 19 to 24 years old;\nP2539I - population from 25 to 39 years old;\nP4069I - population from 40 to 69 years old; and\nP70I - population aged 70 years old and over.\n\n\nThe travel time threshold used to estimate the accessibility levels, which is indicated by the two numbers at the end of the column name. This component only applies to the active and passive cumulative measures. The data includes accessibility estimates calculated with cutoffs of 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, depending on the transport mode.\n\nExamples:\n\nCMAEF30: number of accessible primary public schools within 30 minutes of travel;\nTMISB: minimum travel time to the closest low complexity public health facility; and\nCMPPM60: number of women that can access a certain grid cell within 60 minutes of travel.\n\nThe full description of the columns can also be found in the function documentation, running the ?read_access command in R. The following sections show examples illustrating how to create spatial visualizations and charts out of the accessibility dataset.",

    "text": "1.5 Accessibility inequalities\nFinally, {aopdata} accessibility dataset can be used to analyze accessibility inequalities across different Brazilian cities in several different ways. In this subsection, we present three examples of this type of analysis.\n\n1.5.1 Inequality in travel time to access opportunities\nIn this first example, we compare the average travel time to the nearest high complexity public hospital for people of different income levels. To do this, we calculate, for each income group, the average travel time to reach the nearest high complexity hospital, weighted by the population of each grid cell. Weighting the travel time by population is necessary because each cell has a different population size, thus contributing differently to the average accessibility of the population as a whole.\nBefore performing the calculation, we should note that some grid cells cannot reach any high complexity hospital within two hours of travel. In such cases, the columns with minimum travel time information assume an infinite value (Inf). To deal with this situation in our example, we replace all Inf values by a travel time of 120 minutes.\n\n# copies access data into a new data.frame\nineq_pt &lt;-data.table::as.data.table(access_pt)\n\n# replaces Inf values with 120\nineq_pt [, TMISA := ifelse(is.infinite(TMISA), 120, TMISA)]\n\n# calculates the average travel time by income decile\nineq_pt &lt;- ineq_pt[\n  ,\n  .(avrg = weighted.mean(x = TMISA, w = P001, na.rm = TRUE)),\n  by = R003\n]\nineq_pt &lt;- subset(ineq_pt, ! is.na(avrg))\n\nggplot(ineq_pt) +\n  geom_col(aes(y = avrg, x = factor(R003)), fill = \"#2c9e9e\", color = NA) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n      labels = c(\"D1\\npoorest\", paste0(\"D\", 2:9), \"D10\\nwealthiest\")\n  ) +\n  labs(x = \"Income decile\", y = \"Travel time (minutes)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Average travel time by public transport to the nearest high complexity hospital in São Paulo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Inequality in the number of accessible opportunities\nAnother way of examining accessibility inequalities is by comparing the number of opportunities that can be reached by different population groups considering the same transport modes and travel time limits. In this case, we analyze the total number of jobs accessible by people of different income deciles by public transport in up to 60 minutes. To do this, we look at the active cumulative access (CMA) to total jobs (TT) in to up to 60 minutes, which is represented by the column CMATT60 in the dataset.\n\nggplot(subset(access_pt, !is.na(R003))) +\n  geom_boxplot(\n    aes(x = factor(R003), y = CMATT60 / 1000000, color = factor(R003))\n  ) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"RdBu\") +\n  labs(\n    color = \"Income\\ndecile\",\n    x = \"Income decile\",\n    y = \"Accessible jobs (millions)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    labels = c(\"D1\\npoorest\", paste0(\"D\", 2:9), \"D10\\nwealthiest\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Distribution of job accessibility by public transport in up to 60 minutes of travel in São Paulo\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can also compare how the usage of different transport modes can lead to different accessibility levels and how the discrepancy between modes varies across cities. In the example below, we compare the number of jobs that one can access in up to 30 minutes of walking and driving. To do this, we first download accessibility estimates by both transport modes for all cities included in the {aopdata} package.\n\ndata_car &lt;- aopdata::read_access(\n  city = \"all\",\n  mode = \"car\",\n  year = 2019,\n  showProgress = FALSE\n)\n\ndata_walk &lt;- aopdata::read_access(\n  city = \"all\",\n  mode = \"walk\",\n  year = 2019,\n  showProgress = FALSE\n)\n\nNext, we calculate, for each city and transport mode, the weighted average number of jobs accessible by trips of up to 30 minutes (CMATT30). We then join these estimates together into a single table and calculate the ratio between car and walk accessibility levels.\n\navg_car &lt;- data_car[\n  ,\n  .(access_car = weighted.mean(CMATT30, w = P001, na.rm = TRUE)),\n  by = name_muni\n]\n\navg_walk &lt;- data_walk[\n  ,\n  .(access_walk = weighted.mean(CMATT30, w = P001, na.rm = TRUE)),\n  by = name_muni\n]\n\n# merges the data and calculates the ratio between access by car and on foot\navg_access &lt;- merge(avg_car, avg_walk)\navg_access[, ratio := access_car / access_walk]\n\nhead(avg_access)\n\nKey: &lt;name_muni&gt;\n        name_muni access_car access_walk    ratio\n           &lt;char&gt;      &lt;num&gt;       &lt;num&gt;    &lt;num&gt;\n1:          Belem   155270.4    9392.235 16.53179\n2: Belo Horizonte   529890.0   12464.233 42.51284\n3:       Brasilia   220575.9    4110.703 53.65892\n4:       Campinas   256333.1    6748.923 37.98133\n5:   Campo Grande   172680.5    4181.209 41.29919\n6:       Curitiba   494376.9   10471.135 47.21331\n\n\nFinally, we can analyze the results using a chart:\n\nggplot(avg_access, aes(x = ratio, y = reorder(name_muni, ratio))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x = ratio + 3 , label = paste0(round(ratio), \"x\"))) +\n  labs(y = NULL, x = \"Ratio between car and walk accessibility\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Ratio between job accessibility levels by car and by foot considering trips of up to 30 minutes in the 20 biggest Brazilian cities\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, Figure 1.5 shows that car trips lead to much higher accessibility levels than equally long walking trips. This difference, however, greatly varies across cities. In São Paulo and Brasília, a 30-minute car trip allows one to access, on average, 54 times more jobs than what it would be possible to access with walking trips. In Belém, the city from our sample with the smallest difference, one can access 17 times more jobs by car than by foot - still a substantial difference, but much smaller than in other cities.\n\n\n\n\nBrodsky, Isaac. 2018. “H3: Uber’s Hexagonal Hierarchical Spatial Index.” Uber Engineering Blog. https://eng.uber.com/h3/.\n\n\nPereira, Rafael H.
